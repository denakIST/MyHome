                    My name is Deniz Akar. I’m a marketing analytics leader with over 15 years of experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently I have joined MIT’s FullStack Professional Certificate program to pursue my interest in web
                    development.
                    Throughout my experience I have collaborated with software developers on several projects, and always
                    admired
                    them for having the skills that enable them to take a concept and turn it into a product that people can
                    use. And that has been a catalyst for me to take the leap to join the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have extensive experience in marketing analytics. I started my professional
                    life in predictive statistical modeling which was largely regarded as a 'black box' by the marketers. Fast forward 10-15 years, the proliferation of
                    "Big Data"
                    and
                    "Machine Learning" methods gave black-box a new meaning. This left both providers and clients of data
                    and
                    information with
                    a whole set of new challenges to overcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who appreciates the power of taking highly complex and technical topics and communicating
                    them in
                    simple
                    terms, my goal in pursuing fullstack development is to be able to build products that help make
                    analytics the
                    most
                    important part of every professional’s toolbox. This web site is aimed at tracking the journey with the
                    intent
                    of
                    continuously adding, updating and improving it along the way.
